## Day 5
**What was discussed:** material from Lecture 5 is mostly contained in
+ [Combining Logics](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15816-f16/lectures/12-combining.pdf)
+ [Asynchronous Communication](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15816-f16/lectures/13-async.pdf)
 
and a recent paper
 
Stephanie Balzer and Frank Pfenning,  
[Manifest Sharing with Session Types](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/papers/icfp17.pdf),  
ICFP 2017, to appear.  
([extended version](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/papers/CMU-CS-17-106R.pdf))
 
If you have downloaded and compiled CC0, you will be able to use shared processes, 
following the examples in the cc0-concur/tests/sharing/*.c1 examples 
(which include several producer/consumer examples and the traditional dining philosophers).
