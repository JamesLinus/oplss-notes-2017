Hello everyone,

Thanks for your interest in the background on computational type theory, which I presented today for my last lecture.

The most immediate reference would be to the NuPRL book, http://nuprl.org/book/, which summarizes both the theory and the system. It is dated in some respects, but nevertheless conveys the essential ideas. For more on NuPRL and its semantics, see the rest of http://nuprl.org, where there are dozens, maybe hundreds, of papers on the subject.

The most important background is the many works of Per Martin-Loef on intuitionistic type theory, which have been cached at https://github.com/michaelt/martin-lof. I would mention in particular his Constructive Mathematics and Computer Programming, and his articles about judgments and truth in logic. These are essential reading for anyone in this field.

The RedPRL system and related work is available at http://redprl.org. This is the focus of our implementation activity at the moment, and contains references to recent papers related to the effort. I anticipate that some further publications will be coming out later this summer, so please keep an eye on this site for the latest developments.

I would like to say that I owe an enormous debt to Bob Constable, in particular, for teaching me about type theory starting way back in 1980. Working with him set the course of my life, and he continues to be an inspiration to me as a computer scientist.
