# Gradual Typing -- Garcia

**Instructor:** Ronald Garcia (University of British Colombia)


Ron's note on Piazza:

Hi All,


Inspired by David's lectures, I wrote Redex models of both BA and TBA, which are included here.   I tried to keep the files very similar so that you can see the differences in your favourite graphical diff tool.  

 

Two exercises that I recommend:

1) add pairs "(pair t t) (first t) (second t)" to either/both languages

2) add let "(let ([x t]) t)" to either/both languages

 

#2 is more involved because you have to add substitution to your language, and you have to update the typing judgment with contexts. 

 

I will update the pdf for the semanticses (at least bug fixes) @40 , so keep your eyes peeled for a timestamp update on that note.
