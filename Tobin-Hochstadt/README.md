# Contracts and Gradual Types -- Tobin‑Hochstadt

**Instructor:** Dr. Sam Tobin‑Hochstadt (Indiana University)


## Day 1--2

1. the bulk of my presentation is based on this paper: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/esop12-dthf.pdf

2. the original paper on the semantics of contracts is: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/icfp2002-ff.pdf

3. the paper introducing the "indy" semantics and defining "blame correctness" is: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/popl11-dfff.pdf (mentioned above)

4. another useful paper on the semantics of contracts, and what it means to satisfy a contract: http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/df-toplas11.pdf


## Day 3--4

1. For today's lecture, the presentation is derived from http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/dls06-tf.pdf which introduces blame for gradual typing and the blame theorem


2. and the proof technique I mentioned is from http://www.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/esop12-dthf.pdf

3. the paper introducing the "Gradual Guarantee" is http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2015/5031/

4. also, @jonsterling for more about symbolic execution & contracts see https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04817 from JFP this year which expands on that paper
